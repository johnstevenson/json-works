# Json-Works

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/aoberoi/json-works.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/aoberoi/json-works)

A PHP library to create, edit, query and validate [JSON](http://www.json.org/).

**NOTE:** This package is a fork of an existing library by [John Stevenson](https://github.com/johnstevenson):
[johnstevenson/json-works](https://github.com/johnstevenson/json-works). This package will be
maintained separately and is listed on [packagist](https://packagist.org) separately. It still
retains the namespace `\JohnStevenson` as with the original. The purpose of forking was simply to
apply a [fix](https://github.com/johnstevenson/json-works/pull/2) that had not been accepted
upstream.

## Usage

See [johnstevenson/json-works](https://github.com/johnstevenson/json-works).

## Contribution

Please help point out any progress in the upstream package so that this project can stay up to date.
Otherwise, please send any contributions there.
